# CANDL
Congregated Algorithms and Data structures Library, or CANDL for short, is a project dedicated to providing a wide berth of algorithms to anyone across the web. Whether you need a simple binary search or a Levenshtein distance function, CANDL should have what you need, in as many programming languages as possible.
